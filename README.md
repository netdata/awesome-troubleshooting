- [Debugging Latency](https://exa.net.uk/latency-debugging/): For the past couple of weeks, our active monitoring detected several occasions where the latency of traffic going through our SurfProtect service increased significantly enough to be worthy of investigation.
- [Debugging Latency – Redux](https://exa.net.uk/debugging-latency-redux/): Not so long ago, we posted an [article](https://exa.net.uk/latency-debugging/) that detailed an issue impacting SurfProtect service stability. We described our investigation into the cause of the problem and celebrated its resolution.
